    Communities want to work with us because we help projects thrive and truly
    believe that collaboration is the key to success.  The OSF staff is a small
    team, but we make a big impact. Collectively we support the largest, most
    active, and engaged open  source infrastructure communities globally.

    OSF operates efficiently based on years of experience figuring out what
    works and what doesn’t, with a focus on community  development. We dedicate
    our resources towards advancing the project goals and growing adoption. Our
    strength lies in the  communities we serve. Inquire about hosting your

    At OSF we value project individuality and collaboration. The quality of each
    project is our main focus, not the overall  quantity of projects we host.
    There is no template or a one-size-fits-all model for the way we engage and
    support open  source projects. Each project is unique and each community has
    specific needs. We welcome every project with personalized  support and
    attention to detail. Our team is genuinely welcoming, helpful, knowledgeable
    and passionate about helping  communities grow and thrive. We do not sit on
    the sidelines; we actively participate in each and every community that we
    serve        
  text2: >-
    Our model provides the support system and collaborative environment where
    communities are able to focus their attention  on the important work of
    building and operating software that solves real problems around the globe.
