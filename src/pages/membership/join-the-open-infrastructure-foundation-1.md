We believe digital infrastructure is core to human progress in every country, company and industry. We’ve created a community driven open source approach which is the best way to openly develop technology that is broadly available for use around the world.

## Open Source Communities the OpenInfra Foundation Supports

Staying true to our mission of helping people build and operate open infrastructure, OpenInfra Foundation supports open source projects contributing to the advancement of today’s infrastructure. From cloud hosting to the driving force behind 5G, these projects are code first and operate under the guiding principles we call the “[Four Opens](/four-opens/)”.
