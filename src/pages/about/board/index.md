    description: >-
      I started my working career in technology close to twenty years ago. It
      has surely not  been an average career, but a career where I've
      continually learned and evolved to fulfill the need. In  a sense, it all
      started with Linux and answering some questions about installing Linux.
      This started a  journey into computer networking and eventually shifted to
      a systems engineering focus with a stop-over  in data center
      operations.</p> 

      <p>The DevOps movement lead me more into software development and the operationalization of software due  to the need to automate large scale systems deployments. This required bringing an operational perspective  while bridging to the requirements, and often required digging deep into the underlying code to solve the  problem of the day.</p> 

      <p>In a sense, I found a home in OpenStack in 2014 and the Ironic project in 2015 because of many years  spent working with physical hardware in data centers.</p> <p>I presently work for Red Hat as a Principal Software Engineer, where my upstream focus has been Ironic  for the past few years, and my downstream focus has been on helping lead adoption and use of Ironic.

      their change in direction.


      Dec 2018 - Dec 2019, I was responsible for the Cloud and Storage Departments in SUSE R&D.

      SUSE builds and maintains the SUSE and Helion OpenStack Cloud Products, is a platinum member of the Foundation and a strong upstream contributor.


      Before SUSE, I was leading the architecture, community and consulting teams in Deutsche Telekom's Open Telekom Cloud Team.


      DT has been a vocal supporter of OpenStack since I joined in early 2012 -- we have been able to run several OpenStack projects. We have participated in most OpenStack Summits and are active in a few working groups. I personally support the InterOp Workig Group, a key area for OpenStack's success given the centrifugal forces in such a large project. DT has become gold member of the OpenStack Foundation in 2016 and has been headline sponsor for a few summits (Barcelona, Boston, Berlin). I was serving in the board in most of 2018 until I handed over to Clemens Hardewig.


      Before joining DT end of 2011 I was a long-time contributor to the Linux kernel, which also gave me the privilege of building up and leading SUSE Labs and work with a number of great engineers in- and outside my company, contributing to the success of the Open Source technology.
