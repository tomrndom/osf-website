  - description: Jonathan Bryce, who has spent his career building the cloud, is
      Executive Director of the Open Infrastructure Foundation. Previously he
      was a founder of The Rackspace Cloud. He started his career working as a
      web developer for Rackspace, and during his tenure, he and  co-worker Todd
      Morey had a vision to build a sophisticated web hosting environment where
      users and  businesses alike could turn to design, develop and deploy their
      ideal web site – all without being  responsible for procuring the
      technology, installing it or making sure it is built to be
      always  available. This vision became The Rackspace Cloud. Since then he
      has been a major driver of  OpenStack, the open source cloud software
      initiative.</p>

      new open source cloud  computing project called OpenStack, in partnership
      with NASA and 25 other organizations globally.  OpenStack quickly became
      one of the fastest growing open source projects in history. In 2012,
      Mark  co-founded the Open Infrastructure Foundation to manage the growth
      of the project, where he now serves at  the COO. Today, OpenStack is one
      of the 3 most actively developed open source projects in the world,  along
      with the Linux kernel and Chromium.</p> <p>Mark is now helping to expand
